On Windows 11, WSL can be installed with a simple command: wsl --install. Although you might need to enable Hyper-V, and perhaps do it before the installation, as it will cause the installation to fail.
To enable Hyper-V on Windows 11 system, open Control Panel, then go to: Programs -> Programs and Features -> Turn Windows features on and off. Scroll to the bottom, and select "Windows Subsystem for Linux". 
Then restart your computer to enable this config.
As the system is booted up again, use ```wsl --install``` in your cmd box and wait for the installation to complete.
A welcome page will pop up after the installation, which includes pretty much what you're need to know. In summary:
- Windows file are mounted to WSL /mnt folder.
- WSL root path is accessible on Windows File Explorer, on the left side bar look for "Linux". (I can't quite find a folder that stores the WSL files and OS image in Windows system, although it was possible in Windows 10. More to explore here) 
- The default Linux distribution is Ubuntu, 24.04. To install another districution, use ```wsl.exe -l -o``` for installable distributions, and then install with ```wsl.exe --install <DistroName>```
- The disc image is on %LOCALAPPDATA%\wsl\{}
